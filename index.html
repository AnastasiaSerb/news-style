   <p align="justify">Prince William and Catherine posed at the mausoleum in Agra on the final day of their tour of India and Bhutan.
     William's mother was captured sitting alone in front of the monument to love in 1992, shortly before the break up of her marriage to the Prince of Wales.

  <p align="justify"><em>Breaking Bad's Wendy, by contrast, is initially not much more than a sight gag, though one whose character grows over her three appearances in the series. At first, she's the spaced-out, meth-addicted sex partner of Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul), and is used as a this-could-be-your-life example by DEA Agent Hank Schrader (Dean Norris) when he cluelessly attempts to caution his nephew about the dangers of drug use. But she takes on new shades in her third and final appearance, during a sex montage scored to The Association's upbeat pop hit Windy. With every customer she encounters she becomes that much more of a tragic figure.  </em></p>
